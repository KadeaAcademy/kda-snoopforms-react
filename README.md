This repository is still work in progress in an early phase. We love the open source community and want to show early on what we are working on. Will will update this readme with more information as soon as it's safe to use. Until then, please feel free to share your thoughts, get in touch and contribute if you like.

## Installation

```
npm install @snoopforms/react
```

## How to use

Use the SnoopForm components to build your form easily. Use the `SnoopForm` wrapper to make the connection to the SnoopForm Data-Platform. Use `SnoopPage` to tell the Form where you need an new page. The SnoopForms library will only show the current page to the user. That way you can build long, more complex forms or a Typeform-like form-view, where you change the page after every question.
You can choose your `SnoopElements` from a wide range of pre-coded components, including text, email, checkboxes, radio-buttons, color-pickers, and many more.

```jsx
<SnoopForm domain="example.com" formId={"abcde123"}>
  <SnoopPage name="first">
    <SnoopElement type="text" name={"name"} label="Your name" />
    <SnoopElement
      type="radio"
      name={"importance"}
      label="What's your favorite food?"
      options={["Pizza", "Pasta", "Sushi"]}
    />
    <SnoopSubmit label="Submit ðŸ’ª">
  </SnoopPage>
</SnoopForm>
```
